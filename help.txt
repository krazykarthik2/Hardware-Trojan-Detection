        ->trains mlp model and uses GridSearchCV to finetune params and analyses difference between train_time and accuracy of the model
    |--gradient_boosting:
        ->trains gradient_boosting model and uses GridSearchCV to finetune params and analyses difference between train_time and accuracy of the model
    |--k_neighbors:
        ->trains k_neighbors model and uses GridSearchCV to finetune params and analyses difference between train_time and accuracy of the model
